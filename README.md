Automate testing and tasks with Selenium and Python


If you are not familiar with Selenium, it is an open-source automation tool. Selenium web-driver can mimic a web browser and complete testing and data collection functions that a human would need to manually do. 


In this example, we use a Jupyter Notebook and Python to run Selenium. We will use Selenium to log into Instagram and copy all of the comments of a particular post. This can be used later for data analysis or to track giveaway contests on Instagram for instance. 


First, you will need to import Pip if you have not done so already in Python. Pip is the de facto package management system for Python. We then use pip to install selenium and webdriver-manager. Webdriver-manager will download and manage the browser you will use for testing (i.e.Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE and Microsoft Edge). 
 
Part of the code using the Selenium library will tell your test browser where to go, what to click, what to save and how long to test for. 

Python and Selenium can automate anything that requires repetition. For ease of use, you can run all of the code at once, grab a coffee while selenium does all of the heavy lifting for you.
